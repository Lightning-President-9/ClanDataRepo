# Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to collecting and maintaining data files for Clan Members, Former Clan Members, and Top Contributors. The data is available in four formats: PDF, JSON, CSV, and Excel. Starting from June 2024, new files are added monthly, time permitting.

# Important Update
As of May 2024, there was a major update to the database and the JavaScript used for exporting files. The column name 'clancapitalattack' has been changed to 'clancapital'. Additionally, headers in all file formats, except PDF, have been cleaned for easier manipulation in subsequent use.
