# Project Overview
This repository is committed to gathering and holding files containing Clan Members data, Former Clan Members data, and Top Contributors data. The files are supported in four file formats: PDF, JSON, CSV, and Excel. From June 2024, fresh files are uploaded every month, subject to time availability.

## Important Update
Up to June 2024, there was a significant upgrade of the database and the JavaScript employed in file exporting. The column name 'clancapitalattack' has been updated to 'clancapital'. Furthermore, headers in all file types, except PDF, have been sanitized for simpler handling in future use.

## Note
`-1` indicates the member was not in the clan during that period â€“ see data in [JSON](https://github.com/Lightning-President-9/ClanDataRepo/tree/main/Clan%20Members/Clan%20Monthly%20Performance%20JSON) or [CSV](https://github.com/Lightning-President-9/ClanDataRepo/tree/main/Clan%20Members/Clan%20Monthly%20Performance) formats.
